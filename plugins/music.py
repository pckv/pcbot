""" Plugin for playing music.

Some of the logic is very similar to the example at:
    https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/blob/master/examples/playlist.py

TUTORIAL:
    This module would require the bot to have ffmpeg installed and set in
    PATH, so that one could run `ffmpeg` in the shell.
    See: https://www.ffmpeg.org/

    The bot owner can link a music channel to any voice channel in a guild
    using the !music link <voice channel ...> command. After doing this, the
    bot should automatically join the linked channel whenever a member plays a song.
    The members in the channel can then manage music playing.

ISSUES:
    The music player seems to randomly start skipping songs, or rather
    stopping them way too early. I have no solution to this issue and do not
    know why it happens, but apparently I'm not the only bot creator who has
    experienced said issue.

Commands:
